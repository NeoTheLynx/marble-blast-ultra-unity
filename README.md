# Marble Blast Gold Unity Port

The unity port of the classic game Marble Blast Gold, with the most accurate physics (although not identical). This project started from CyberFox's [MarblePhysics Unity](https://github.com/CyberFoxHax/MarblePhysicsUnity) that already has a faithful marble movement physics, then continued with codes based on [Marble Blast Web Port](https://github.com/Vanilagy/MarbleBlast) and [Marble Blast Haxe Port](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/MBHaxe/). The Unity version used is Unity 2022.3.62f3. Note that this version of the Narble Blast Gold Unity Port does not implement Traplaunches.

As the time of me writing this, the game has not been fully tested as I don't have the skill and capability to complete all levels.

## Download the Windows build [here](https://github.com/NaCl586/mbg-unity-revisited/releases/tag/1.2)

If you find bugs or things that are not faithful with the original Marble Blast Gold, feel free to message me on discord NaCl586#8479.

Special thanks to Vani and RandomityGuy for helping me whenever I have problems when making this project.

## Additional Controls

Press R for quick respawn, works when the game is paused. This button currently is not remappable because I wanted to create the same UI remake without additional things. Also, setting video driver and color mode is just pure cosmetic and does not work.

## Save Data

Save data uses [PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html), which can be accessed via Registry Editor (see picture). If you wanna unlock the levels, you can create a key or edit existing key called "QualifiedLevel[Difficulty]" to a large integer like 9999. The PlayerPrefs essentially is equivalent to prefs.cs in vanilla Marble Blast.

## Custom Level Support

You can add custom levels that are specifically made for Marble Blast Gold by placing the mission file in Marble Blast_Data\StreamingAssets\marble\data\missions\custom and the interior file in Marble Blast_Data\StreamingAssets\marble\data\interiors (or wherever you put your .dif files when making the level). Adding new folders or custom levels that are not made for Marble Blast Gold do not work. You can technically add more levels to the main game with the same fashion. This feature is theoretically working but still untested.
